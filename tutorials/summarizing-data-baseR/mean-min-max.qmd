title: "Calculating summary statistics of variables"
---

The examples in this lesson are based on a dataset about profits from stocks and bonds. First, we have a look at the dataset:


```{r, echo = FALSE}
stocks <- read.csv(here::here("data", "stocks.csv"), header = TRUE, sep = ",", dec = ".", na.string = c("", "NA"))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(stocks)
```

This is what we see:

![](/assets/figures/view_stocks.png)
The dataset contains information about the average change in the price of stocks and bonds during the period 1928-2015. Below is a description of the variables that can be found in the dataset.

-   **YEAR**: the year
-   **TBONDS**: Price of Treasury Bonds, US government bonds. For example, a figure of 4 means an increase of 4%.
-   **SPSTOCKS**: S&P 500 Stocks price, shares of the 500 largest US companies. For example, a figure of 44 means an increase of 44%.
-   **TBONDS_D**: Indicates whether Treasury Bonds rose (1) or fell/remained the same (0) that year.
-   **SPSTOCKS_D**: Indicates whether the S&P 500 stocks rose (1) or fell/remained the same (0) that year.


We will explore this dataset. At the start, we are interested to get more information about our collected variables. In most cases, we want at least to know the following parameters:

-   the mean
-   the standard deviation
-   the range (minimum and maximum)

For this purpose, R provides the following functions: 

```{r, eval= FALSE}
mean()
sd()
min()
max()
```

You can use these for a single variable (at a time). You can call up each variable by adding $‘variable name’ after the name of the data frame.

## Practice

Try requesting the mean of TBONDS from the Stocks dataset. 

:::: {.panel-tabset}
## {{< var tab_title.editor >}}

```{webr-r}

```

## {{< var tab_title.solution >}}

```{r}
mean(stocks$TBONDS)
```
